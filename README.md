MultiPlayerWormsGame
====================
This game is implemented based on the WORMS game. Two players can play with each other over the LAN. 
The worm who passes the obstacles and reaches the finish line earlier is the winner. 
A player can basically choose from the games that have already initiated by another player in the 
network or start a new one.

The code is designed and developed in Java by 4 software engineer undergraduate students as the final project
of the Advanced Software Engineering course. 
My contribution was mainly in the netwrok communication manager component. 

To run the game: 
1- Add lib directory to your CLASSPATH 
2- Run networkManager\GameServer.java to start the server and then 
3- Run startupUI\pages\Engine.java to initiate your game!
